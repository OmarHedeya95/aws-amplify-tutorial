## Local Development Setup

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
# Clone your forked repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/amplify-react-lambda-dynamodb-example.git

# Navigate into the directory
cd amplify-react-lambda-dynamodb-example
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install all npm packages
npm install

# This installs:
# - React and React DOM
# - AWS Amplify libraries
# - Amplify UI React components
# - TypeScript dependencies
# - Development tools
```

### Step 3: Set Up Amplify Sandbox

The Amplify Sandbox is a cloud development environment that:
- Deploys your backend to AWS temporarily
- Creates real AWS resources (Lambda, DynamoDB, Cognito)
- Watches for changes and auto-deploys
- Provides the same environment as production

```bash
# Start the Amplify Sandbox
npx ampx sandbox

# What happens:
# 1. Amplify analyzes your backend configuration
# 2. Creates CloudFormation stacks
# 3. Deploys Lambda functions
# 4. Creates DynamoDB tables
# 5. Sets up Cognito user pool
# 6. Generates amplify_outputs.json
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Deploying...
âœ“ Auth deployed
âœ“ Data deployed
âœ“ Functions deployed
âœ“ Backend deployed successfully

Sandbox environment ready!
```

**Keep this terminal window open** - the sandbox watches for changes.

### Step 4: Start the React App

Open a **new terminal window**:

```bash
# Start the development server
npm start

# The app will open at http://localhost:3000
```

## Understanding the Architecture

### Component Flow Diagram

```
User Browser
    â†“
React App (localhost:3000)
    â†“
AWS Amplify Client
    â†“
    â”œâ”€â†’ Amazon Cognito (Authentication)
    â”œâ”€â†’ AWS AppSync (GraphQL API)
    â”‚     â†“
    â”‚     â”œâ”€â†’ DynamoDB (Direct access for CRUD)
    â”‚     â””â”€â†’ Lambda Functions (Custom logic)
    â”‚           â†“
    â”‚           â””â”€â†’ DynamoDB (Batch operations)
    â””â”€â†’ AWS Lambda (Serverless functions)
```

### What Each Service Does

#### 1. **React Frontend**
- User interface
- Handles user interactions
- Makes API calls to backend
- Receives real-time updates

#### 2. **AWS Amplify**
- Manages backend configuration
- Handles authentication flow
- Provides data client for DynamoDB
- Orchestrates all services

#### 3. **Amazon Cognito**
- User registration and login
- Password management
- Email verification
- Secure token generation

#### 4. **AWS AppSync (GraphQL)**
- API layer between frontend and backend
- Automatically generated from your schema
- Handles authorization
- Provides real-time subscriptions

#### 5. **AWS Lambda**
- Serverless functions
- Custom business logic
- Batch operations
- Statistics calculations

#### 6. **Amazon DynamoDB**
- NoSQL database
- Stores todo items
- Automatic scaling
- Low latency reads/writes

---

## Testing Locally

### 1. Test Authentication

```bash
# In your browser at localhost:3000

1. Click "Create Account"
2. Enter email and password
3. Verify email (check your inbox)
4. Sign in

# Behind the scenes:
# - Cognito creates a user
# - Sends verification email
# - Generates authentication token
# - Token stored in browser
```

### 2. Test Todo Operations

```bash
# Create a todo
1. Type in the input field
2. Select priority
3. Click "Add Todo"

# What happens:
# - React calls Amplify client
# - Client sends GraphQL mutation to AppSync
# - AppSync writes to DynamoDB
# - Real-time subscription pushes update to UI
```

### 3. Test Real-Time Updates

```bash
# Open two browser windows side by side
1. Sign in to the same account in both
2. Add a todo in one window
3. Watch it appear instantly in the other

# This demonstrates:
# - GraphQL subscriptions
# - Real-time data sync
# - WebSocket connections
```

### 4. Verify Backend Resources

```bash
# Check AWS Console
1. Go to https://console.aws.amazon.com
2. Select your region (e.g., us-east-1)

# DynamoDB:
- Go to DynamoDB â†’ Tables
- Find table with 'Todo' in the name
- Click "Explore items" to see your data

# Lambda:
- Go to Lambda â†’ Functions
- See 'process-todo' and 'get-stats' functions
- Click on each to view configuration

# Cognito:
- Go to Cognito â†’ User pools
- Find your user pool
- See registered users
```
